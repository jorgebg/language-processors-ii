-- Square and Rectangle Area.
-- Test4 receives as parameter a boolean 
	true if we want to find the area of a square, 
	false if we want to find the area of a rectangle -! -!

public CLASS Test4.

I need to define the public static void METHOD main (String[] args):
the method needs to check IF (args->length != 1) 
	THEN it prints ("The number of given arguments is wrong.")
	-- in SNL is allowed to do things like squareArea(read) it is much faster -!
	ELSE IF (args[0]->equals("true") equals to true) 
	THEN it prints ("The area of the square is: "+ squareArea(read))
	ELSE it prints ("The area of the rectangle is: "+ rectangleArea(read, read))
	END_IF 
END_METHOD.

I create the public static int FUNCTION squareArea(int side):
the function returns side * side END_FUNCTION.

I create also the public static int FUNCTION rectangleArea(int side1,int side2):
the function creates the VARIABLE int area = side1*side2 --END_VARIABLE-!;
the function returns area END_FUNCTION
